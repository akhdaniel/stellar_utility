preinstructions to install stellar horizon
upgrade postgresql to verision 9.4 or better
this is not part of standard repository at the time of this writing so added repository is needed:

wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | \
  sudo apt-key add -

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ trusty-pgdg main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/postgresql.list'
# optionaly follow the steps at http://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/ that do the same as above

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.4 
sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib-9.4

to setup for all user on system to have access to postgress
see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18664074/getting-error-peer-authentication-failed-for-user-postgres-when-trying-to-ge
or:
open the file pg_hba.conf for ubuntu it will be in /etc/postgresql/9.x/main and change the this line:

local   all             postgres                                peer
to:
local   all             all                                     trust
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust

Restart the server:
sudo service postgresql restart

before starting the install process of horizon create this source_me.sh file that you will source before 
you run bin/setup in the next instruction we point you to

export DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:none@localhost:5432/horizon?sslmode=disable"
export STELLAR_CORE_DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:none@localhost:5432/stellar?sslmode=disable"
export IMPORT_HISTORY=true

#change the username and password accordingly if you changed pg_hba.conf to add more security

$source ./source_me.sh
  at this point continue instructions in developing.md
  also be sure to rbenv rehash after bundle install
...  ./bin/setup
# this must be sourced every time you start horizon in the future

continue to follow instructions seen at: https://github.com/stellar/horizon/blob/master/doc/developing.md
just be sure to source ./source_me.sh before you continue on with ./bin/setup   


note this was with commit 01122be of horizon the same that I was told is now running on horizon-test.stellar.org
at this point the return seen from bin/setup is:

#this must be a good thing?

#at this point you can now start the server
./source source_me.sh
./bin/rails server

# I also wrote a script with that above that starts the server

you will now see some text and finaly says now active on localhost:3000
