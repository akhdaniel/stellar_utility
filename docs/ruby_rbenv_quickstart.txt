ruby rbenv with bundler project quickstart:

cd into/project/path

#if new version of ruby needed
rbenv versions  # see what's available and what's set to run
rbenv install 1.9.3-p484
# set that installed version to run in this path 1.9.3-p484 is default ubuntu version
rbenv local 1.9.3-p484
# if this is a new installed version of ruby you will also need to install bundler
gem install bundler

bundle exec gem update --system   #not sure this is needed

bundle init
# now modify the Gemfile in your project path that was created by init above
# to include all gem "youwant"

# now install all the gems in Gemfile with:
bundle install

#after new gems installed
rbenv rehash

#to run your ruby app
bundler exec ruby ./yourrubyapp.rb
bundler exec rails --version

#what I found that might work for corupted gems like json
cd /to/rubyproject
bundle install --force
bundle exec gem install -f json  #not tested yet


#also might try for corupted gems like json and ffi
cd /to/rubyproject
bundle exec gem pristine --all
bundle exec gem pristine ffi
bundle exec gem pristine json
bundle exec gem pristine pg

#can't find gem?
bundle exec gem list rake --remote --all
