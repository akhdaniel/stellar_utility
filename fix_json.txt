for reasons unknown when using this with rbenv and bundler and moving between rbenv 2.2.1 and 1.9.3
we seem to sometimes have problems with json
example:
sacarlson@sacarlson-asrock ~/github/stellar/stellar_utility $ rr create_account_save.rb
/home/sacarlson/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p484/bin/ruby: symbol lookup error: /home/sacarlson/.bundle/gems/json-1.8.3/lib/json/ext/parser.so: undefined symbol: rb_str_new_static

to fix try:
bundle exec gem pristine json

This will normaly fix this problem
