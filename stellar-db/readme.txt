this is the directory I use to store the sqlite database and the point that I start the stellar-core from.
note: you will have to change the path to your stellar-core bin file as in this case mine was at:
/home/sacarlson/github/stellar/stellar-core/src/stellar-core.  change that to what you plan to be running.
