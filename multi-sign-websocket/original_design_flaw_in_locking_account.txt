seq 1
open
witness and lock the account seq 2 only works if account not locked yet
also send the unlock for seq 3
method fails due to seq 3 unlock won't work after seq used to pay B

send  the unlock for seq 4
method fails due to if we never pay B on seq 3, we cant use unlock tx on seq 4

seq 1
open unlocked account A
lock account A seq 2
fund account A seq 2
get witness from witness server check for funds and lock seq 2
and send unlock for seq 3 after time t if locked already
wait time x unknown time before time t
send payment tx from account A to  B seq 3
before time t end account B sends tx and retrieves payment
wait time t
if never pay B retreive unspent funds with unlock tx
else
ask witness server for new unlock for seq 4
witness server checks for last time witnessed on this account is more than time t
ok time.now - time.then > time t give unlock for seq 4 active after time t boundtime
wait time t
retreive unspent funds seq 4
I think this works!! *************
