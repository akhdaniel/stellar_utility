some of files here are imported from third party sites.
These should be replaced with the later versions available at these point:

http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js

https://github.com/stellar/bower-js-stellar-sdk


The other *.js files here are mostly just examples of using these libs.
